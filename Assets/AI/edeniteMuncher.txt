#Commanded behaviour
#terminating if commander dies, break any command in progress
#keep this rule on top in case of tiebreaks, that way the command will always be broken
CM|If unitLostControl then breakCommand
#idle
CM|If command==idle and newCommand then stopMovement
#flocking (following commander)
CM|If command==moveFlock and newCommand then setFlockLeader and moveInFlock
#attacking
CM|If command==attack and newCommand then setFocusTarget
CM|If command==attack and targetInRange then attackTarget
CM|If command==attack and targetNotInRange then moveTarget
#key difference from player handling: don't break command, sit around and let commander decide what happens next
CM|If command==attack and targetLost then clearTarget and stopMovement
#Basic combat behaviour when idle
