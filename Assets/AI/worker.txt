#For player worker units. Update harvest behaviour to fulfill semi-automatic actions requirement?
#todo: add construction handling
CM|If command==harvest and newCommand then moveToDestination
CM|If command==harvest and reachedDestination then startHarvesting
CM|If command==harvest and depositDepleted then setState=idle and breakCommand
#the part of the handling where the unit moves to construct the building is implemented in AI
#will leave the rest of the construction handling to internal controller
