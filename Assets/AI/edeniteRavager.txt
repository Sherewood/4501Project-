#For edenite ravager's AI behaviour. Edenite Ravager will act as a commander of edenite munchers.
### Searching for munchers to control
#initially, attempt to take control of nearby munchers, and set return point to the unit's spawn position
If init then setReturnPointToCurrentPosition and takeControl
If notAtCommandThreshold and shouldGatherUnits then wanderNearSpawn
If reachedDestination and shouldGatherUnits then stopMovement and takeControl
#logic for fight mode
If reachedCommandThreshold then setFightMode and requestMainBasePos
If positionReceived and shouldFight then moveToDestination
If reachedDestination and shouldFight then stopMovement and requestMainBasePos
#retreating conditions
If unitLost and shouldFight and atRetreatThreshold and outsideSpawnPerimeter then setGatherMode and retreat
#if already within a certain radius of the unit's spawn point, no point in retreating
If unitLost and shouldFight and atRetreatThreshold and insideSpawnPerimeter then setGatherMode
#logic for attacking units
#note: do not want to be attacking units if retreating
If notRetreating and targetChanged and targetNotInRange then setTarget and moveTarget
If notRetreating and targetChanged and targetInRange then setTarget and attackTarget
If notRetreating and targetInRange then attackTarget
If notRetreating and targetNotInRange then moveTarget
#in fight mode, go back to moving towards the main base
If notRetreating and targetLost and shouldFight then clearTarget and stopMovement and requestMainBasePos
#if in gathering unit mode, then return to spawn point
If notRetreating and targetLost and shouldGatherUnits then clearTarget and initReturn
#Special case: if retreating, still need to clear target to avoid unexpected behaviour later
If retreating and targetLost then clearTarget
