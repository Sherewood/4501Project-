#For edenite ravager's AI behaviour. Edenite Ravager will act as a commander of edenite munchers.
### Searching for munchers to control
#initially, attempt to take control of nearby munchers, and set return point to the unit's spawn position
If init then setReturnPointToCurrentPosition and takeControl
If notAtCommandThreshold and shouldGatherUnits then wanderNearSpawn
If reachedDestination and shouldGatherUnits then stopMovement and takeControl
If reachedCommandThreshold then setFightMode
