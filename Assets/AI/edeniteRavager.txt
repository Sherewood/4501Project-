#For edenite ravager's AI behaviour. Edenite Ravager will act as a commander of edenite munchers.
### Searching for munchers to control
#initially, attempt to take control of nearby munchers, and set return point to the unit's spawn position
If init then setReturnPointToCurrentPosition and takeControl
If notAtCommandThreshold and shouldGatherUnits then wanderNearSpawn
If reachedDestination and shouldGatherUnits then stopMovement and takeControl
If reachedCommandThreshold then setFightMode
#logic for fight mode
If reachedDestination and shouldFight then stopMovement
#logic for attacking units
If targetChanged and targetNotInRange then setTarget and moveTarget
If targetChanged and targetInRange then setTarget and attackTarget
If targetInRange then attackTarget
If targetNotInRange then moveTarget
#in fight mode, stay in the area (todo add more logic once functionality for fight mode transition is in)
If targetLost and shouldFight then clearTarget and stopMovement
#if in gathering unit mode, then return to spawn point
If targetLost and shouldGatherUnits then clearTarget and initReturn
