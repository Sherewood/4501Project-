#For edenite ravager's AI behaviour. Edenite Ravager will act as a commander of edenite munchers.
### Searching for munchers to control
#initially, attempt to take control of nearby munchers, and set return point to the unit's spawn position
If init then setReturnPointToCurrentPosition and takeControl
If notAtCommandThreshold and shouldGatherUnits then wanderNearSpawn
If reachedDestination and shouldGatherUnits then stopMovement and takeControl
#logic for fight mode
If reachedCommandThreshold then setFightMode and requestMainBasePos
If positionReceived and shouldFight then moveToDestination
If reachedDestination and shouldFight then stopMovement and requestMainBasePos
#logic for attacking units
If targetChanged and targetNotInRange then setTarget and moveTarget
If targetChanged and targetInRange then setTarget and attackTarget
If targetInRange then attackTarget
If targetNotInRange then moveTarget
#in fight mode, go back to moving towards the main base
If targetLost and shouldFight then clearTarget and stopMovement and requestMainBasePos
#if in gathering unit mode, then return to spawn point
If targetLost and shouldGatherUnits then clearTarget and initReturn
